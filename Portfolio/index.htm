        <b>What is Music?</b><br>
        <p>           Music is a pleasant sound which is a combination of melodies and harmony and which soothes you. 
Music may also refer to the art of composing such pleasant sounds with the help of the various musical instruments.
 A person who knows music is a Musician
The music consists of Sargam, Ragas, Taals, etc. Music is not only what is composed of men but also which exists in nature.
 Have you ever heard the sound of a waterfall or a flowing river? Could you hear music there? Thus, everything in harmony has music. Here, I would like to quote a line by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, one of the greatest musicians, 
“The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.”
    </p><br>
    <b>Importance of Music:</b><br>
        <p>Music has great qualities of healing a person emotionally and mentally. Music is a form of meditation. 
        While composing or listening music ones tends to forget all his worries, sorrows and pains. But, in order to appreciate good music, we need to cultivate our musical taste.
        It can be cited that in the Dwapar Yug, the Gopis would get mesmerized with the music that flowed from Lord Krishna’s flute. They would surrender themselves to Him. 
        Also, the research has proved that the plants which hear the Music grow at a faster rate in comparison to the others.</p>
        <p>It has the power to cure diseases such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, etc. 
            The power of Music can be testified by the legends about Tansen of his bringing the rains by singing Raag Megh Malhar and lighting lamps by Raga Deepak. 
            It also helps in improving the concentration and is thus of great help to the students.</p>
